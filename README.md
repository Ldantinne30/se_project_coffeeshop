# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Project Description

I used :hover to make the links more responsive, and I used transitions such as opacity changes to make the effects smoother for the user. I also used @keyframes to create an animation in the 'About' section that makes the website more engaging to the users.

## Plan on improving the project

I'd like to make room to add some images of the food and coffe served there.
